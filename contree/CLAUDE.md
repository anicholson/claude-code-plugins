# CLAUDE.md

## What This Is

A plugin that unifies test-tree-driven development with living requirements. Test trees ARE the requirements — they live in `TEST_TREES.md` at the project root, describe what the system does using EARS syntax, and are kept in sync with implementation automatically.

Ships under two harnesses from the same `skills/` and `hooks/` directories:

- **Claude Code** — `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `hooks/hooks.json`.
- **Codex CLI** — `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` declaring `"hooks": "./hooks/hooks.json"`. Codex injects `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` (and `PLUGIN_ROOT`) into hook command env, so the existing hook commands work verbatim. `apply_patch` is aliased to match the `Edit|Write` PostToolUse matcher. SessionStart plain stdout becomes `additionalContext`. Stop hook stdin includes `transcript_path` (same shape as Claude). Net: full enforcement on both harnesses from the same hook scripts and hooks.json.

Mechanisms:

- **Directions** — skill routing printed by the SessionStart hook. Names each skill (`change`, `tdd`, `sync`, `setup`, `workflow`) with a one-line trigger so the agent reaches for skills eagerly rather than relying on skill-frontmatter discovery alone. Lives inline in `hooks/session-start.sh`.
- **Rules** — coding principles printed by the SessionStart hook (simplicity, expressiveness, fail-fast, no fake code, etc.). The rules list lives inline in `hooks/session-start.sh` so it ships with the plugin install.
- **setup skill** — prepare the project for ongoing test-tree-driven development. Configures test framework with tree reporters, generates initial test trees, establishes the contract.
- **change skill** — set expected behaviour. Talks through the change, writes or modifies test trees before code exists.
- **sync skill** — identify gaps and cruft. Compares test trees against implementation in both directions — surfaces drift, staleness, and missing coverage.
- **tdd skill** — close gaps. Outside-in TDD where every test traces back to a test tree — one failing test at a time until the contract is fulfilled.
- **workflow skill** — the full arc. Runs `change` → `sync` → `tdd` end to end — from idea to verified working software.
- **Stop hook** — guard the contract. Fires after every response, detecting drift between intent and implementation. Yields the turn silently when the response ends with a question, so questions to the user aren't buried under drift-check output.
- **Mental-model validator (PostToolUse)** — after any tool call that edits MENTAL_MODEL.md, `hooks/post-update-check.sh` runs `hooks/validate-mental-model.sh` and surfaces its advisory findings (missing sections, rogue headings, cap overflow) via additionalContext JSON.
- **Pressure phrase** — inject motivation. The SessionStart hook prints one random pressure phrase (tip-framing, career-stakes, boss-watching, or urgency) alongside the rules, so the agent starts every session under a little stage-light.
- **Self-care hook** — nudge the user. Fires on each `UserPromptSubmit` in any session; records a shared heartbeat and, after 20 minutes of continuous interaction (no gap longer than 5 minutes between heartbeats across any sessions), injects a 20-20-20 eye-break reminder into Claude's context via `additionalContext` so Claude opens its response with the nudge.

## Mental Model

Test trees are the living contract between intent and implementation — both the specification (in `TEST_TREES.md`) and the test structure (in code). They use EARS syntax to choose the right keyword for each requirement — `when` for events, `while` for state, `if/then` for errors, `where` for optional features, bare `then` for ubiquitous constraints. When one behaviour depends on another's outcome, it nests under that outcome (causal nesting) — not as a sibling. Contree prescribes **hexagonal architecture** with dependencies pointing inward and a strict linter (dependency-cruiser for JS/TS) enforcing the boundaries. Tests are layered by architectural seam: **Domain**, **Use-case**, **Adapter** (driving and driven), and **System**. Each driven port ships with an in-memory twin so Use-case and System tests run fast; a shared port contract suite is imported by both the in-memory adapter's test file and the real adapter's test file, making substitution sound. Every behavioural unit gets its own tree in `TEST_TREES.md`; every tree reifies exactly one test file. See `skills/tdd/SKILL.md` for the full framing. `change` sets expected behaviour. `sync` identifies where reality has drifted. `tdd` closes gaps. The stop hook guards the contract — drift is never resolved silently. Coding rules enforce principles (simplicity, expressiveness, fail-fast) across all work.

Flow: `setup` prepares the project for test-tree-driven development → `change` sets expected behaviour → `sync` identifies gaps and cruft → `tdd` closes gaps. Or use `workflow` for the full arc without pausing. The stop hook guards the contract throughout. The SessionStart hook bundles a pressure phrase with the rules to keep the agent sharp. The self-care hook nudges the user to take eye breaks via the 20-20-20 rule. Rules apply always.

## Functional Testing

Run functional tests with `pnpm test:functional` (all) or `bash test/functional/docker-run.sh <test-name>` (one). After the script finishes, it prints the exact transcript file paths. **Always read the transcripts and evaluate each against the VERIFY criteria in docker-entrypoint.sh.** Report PASS/FAIL per criterion with evidence.

## Test Trees

See [TEST_TREES.md](TEST_TREES.md) — the definition of functional and cross-functional requirements.

## Dependencies

The stop hook requires `jq` on the host system.
